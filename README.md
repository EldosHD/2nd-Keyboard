# Why does this Repo exist?
I saw [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Arn8ExQ2Gjg) video by Taran on LTT and wanted to make something similar. So i downloaded his code and tried the Program for my own. But i quickly discoverd, that I didn´t really had a use for it. So I started to delete most of Tarans code and developed some Functions in AHK. I created simple Autoclicker scripts (which I needed for Minecraft) and added a few folder shortcuts. But in the beginning they were really clumsy and unelegant so i polished them a bit. I created an [installer script](https://github.com/EldosHD/myInstallers) in case I needed to install my scripts on another computer or somebody else wanted to try it for themself.

BTW the original idea was developed by [Tom Scott](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIFE7h3m40U&feature=emb_title).

# How does it work?
Idk.

...

Jk. [Lua Macros](http://www.hidmacros.eu/forum/viewtopic.php?f=10&t=241#p794) is a Program that was developed for the flight simulator communtiy. It is able to differentiate between multiple keyboards (cuz Windows can´t for some odd reason). If you press a button on your 2nd Keyboard Lua Macros will intercept that buttonpress (sometimes), write the button which is pressed to a small file on disk and press the F24 Key. AHK will listen for that keypress, read the file on disk and execute the function you assigned to that key.

# How do I use it?
Well First of all you will have to install it.

## Installation Guide
Lucky you! I made an installation script. You can find it [here](https://github.com/EldosHD/myInstallers).
If you want to install it manually, you should watch [Tarans Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Arn8ExQ2Gjg) because he explains everything in there.

## Quickstart Guide
You can use the script without knowing how to code, but you should consider learning AHK
