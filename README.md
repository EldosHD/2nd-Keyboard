# Why does this Repo exist?
I saw this (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Arn8ExQ2Gjg) video by Taran on LTT and wanted to make something similar. So i downloaded his code and tried the Program for my own. But i quickly discoverd, that I didn´t really had a use for it. So I started to delete most of Tarans code and developed some Functions in AHK. I created simple Autoclicker scripts (which I needed for Minecraft) and added a few folder shortcuts. But in the beginning they were really clumsy and unelegant so i polished them a bit. I created a installer script (https://github.com/EldosHD/myInstallers) in case I needed to install my scripts on another computer or somebody else wants to try it for themself.
BTW the original idea was developed by Tom Scott.(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIFE7h3m40U&feature=emb_title)

# How does it work?
Idk.

Jk. Lua Macros (http://www.hidmacros.eu/forum/viewtopic.php?f=10&t=241#p794) is a Program that was developed for the flightsim communtiy. It is able to differentiate between multiple keyboards (cuz Windows can´t for some odd reason). If you press a button on your 2nd Keyboard Lua Macros will intercept that buttonpress (sometimes), write the button to pressed to a small file on disk and press the F24 Key. AHK will listen for that keypress, read the file on disk and execute the function you assigned to that key. 


Thats the code for my 2nd Keyboard. If you want to know more, watch the tutorial I watched to create it.
